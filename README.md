An Adaptive Deep Learning Approach For Autonomous Detection and Classification of Marine Life in Underwater Environments.

The objective aims to demonstrate a computer vision system utilizing the 'Super Gradients' pre-trained model the model's accuracy in identifying and classifying marine organisms, showcasing its effectiveness in feature extraction and classification even under challenging underwater conditions. 
Ultimately, the goal is to enhance marine monitoring efficiency by integrating advanced deep learning techniques, addressing issues related to underwater visibility and species identification, and offering practical solutions for the analysis of ecological data.

The problem is that traditional detection methods struggle to identify cold-blooded marine species in brackish water due to visibility challenges.

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system using the 'Super Gradients' model to enhance the detection and classification of these marine organisms in complex underwater environments.
